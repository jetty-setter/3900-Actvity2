            <p>
            My favorite band is a band called The Maine. They formed in 2007 in Tempe Arizona. The group consists of vocalist, guitarist, and piansist John O'Callaghan, lead guitarist Jared Monaco, bassist Garrett Nickelsen, and drummer Patrick Kirch.

            I have been to over 10 of concerts and plan on seeing The Maine in Denver over Spring Break.
